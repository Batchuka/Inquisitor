    Base class for all states within the state management system.
    Each state is a Singleton, ensuring that only one instance of each specific state is created and necessary.

    Attributes:
        state_machine_operator (callable): Is a function that allows some State manipulate the transition on StateMachine Object.
        _status (bool or None): The status of the last running process, True was successful.
        retry_counter (int): Counter for attempting to execute the state.
        reset (bool): Flag to indicate whether the state should be reset after an error â€” 

    Abstract methods:
        execute: Defines a main state execution logic.
        on_entry: Executed when the state is activated.
        on_exit: Executed when the state completes successfully.
        on_error: Executed when an error occurs during state execution.
